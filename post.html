            <p style="font-style: normal;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align: center;" >One of major advantages of the Internet of Things (IoT) is its massive data-gathering capability. IoT data, when complemented with relevant contextual information, can support business decisions with accurate, dependable, relevant, and timely information for enabling predictive, prescriptive, and other forms of analytics. Improving IoT systems through context-awareness is one of the next greatest challenges in the field.</p>

            <p style="font-style: normal;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">The term “IoT-enabled awareness” refers to the ability of the system, application, or service to be globally aware, including context-aware, situation-aware, event-aware, human-aware, location-aware, and process-aware. IoT data underpins the ability to develop IoT ecosystem-wide awareness of everything that is happening, happened, or might happen within the system realm, whether that is processes, events, activities, locations, or preferences. IoT-enabled awareness is different from self-aware computing.</p>

            <p style="font-style: normal;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">rem Prakash Jayaraman, and Dimitrios Georgakopoulos focus on services for solving problems involving IoT-enabled observation, orientation, decision, and action (OODA) loops. The authors define contextualization as the “process of identifying the data relevant to an entity based on the entity’s contextual information.” They propose a technique for IoT-based contextualization that operates on Internet-scale data (effectively considering the entire dataset collected in smart cities) and uses the data to provide effective and efficient hyper-personalized information based on each user’s context. In essence, they propose a means to transform context obtained from IoT data to develop IoT-enabled awareness services. They provide a smart parking scenario that considers multiple contextual categories, including the driver’s context (such as driver preference and driving experience), the car’s context (such as the car’s dimensions), the parking location context (covered or open and time limit), and the location of the car.</p>

            <p style="font-style: normal;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Karan Mitra, Arkady Zaslavsky, and Christer Åhlund discuss and present network-level and communications-level awareness, as well as propose a decision-theoretic approach for QoE modelling, measurement, and prediction. The proposed system is context-aware and uses Bayesian networks and utility theory to measure and predict users’ QoE under uncertainty. The authors validate the proposed system using extensive experimentation, user studies, and simulations.</p>

            <p style="font-style: normal;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">He identifies semantic, cognitive, and perceptual computing as the pillars for transforming cyber-physical and social data into smart data, giving deeper insights and making data actionable. Semantics underpins the ability to deal and interpret data in context, despite differences in syntax, representation, or structure. The cognitive ability provides a way for the systems to learn, loosely mimicking the process of cognition in the human mind. Finally, perceptual computing systems’ contextual and personalized exploration of the physical world addresses IoT’s awareness challenge. The author presents these areas as foundations for the next evolution of IoT: using IoT data to build a cyber-physical, ecosystem-wide awareness.</p>

            <p style="font-style: normal;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Min-Jung Yoo and colleagues present their ideas and discuss how semantic modelling and ontologies are used to collect and reuse product-service lifecycle data in an IoT-enabled framework. The article discusses the role of product-service ontology as the backbone of vehicle lifecycle management. The authors argue that ontologies and semantic interoperability enable technologies for creating services such as charging location finding and traffic information services. The article illustrates the proposed concepts using an electric vehicle as a case study. Among interesting challenges discussed in the article are multisensory data fusion, semantic reasoning, dealing with uncertainty, and W3C’s Semantic Sensor Ontology (SSNO).</p>
  
            <h1>Conclusion:</h1>

            <p style="font-style: normal;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">We are witnessing a new stage in IoT evolution: IoT ecosystems with context-awareness. The articles and video in this theme issue address various important challenges that IoT-enabled awareness raises and propose solutions that will make the IoT more practicable, feasible, secure, perceptual, cognitive, deployable, and usable. Of course, more research is needed and many more challenges should be resolved before IoT-enabled awareness becomes a core feature of IoT-based applications, systems, and services in the next five to seven years. Interested readers are encouraged to do further research and reading and to join the big community of IoT champions, researchers, developers, architects, and users.</p>
