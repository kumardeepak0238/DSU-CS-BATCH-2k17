            <h5 style="font-style: normal;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 25px;">The software engineering community has been discussing strategies for the systematic evaluation of potential design problems. This issue was raised as early as 1996 by Riel (1996). He presented insights into design improvement and introduced the term “design flaw” in his book. Fowler (1999), who coined the term “code smell”, focused on refactoring and presented a catalog of smells, characterizing and proposing specific actions to remove them. Following suit, Lanza and Marinescu (2005) focused on metrics and heuristics to detect what they called “disharmonies”.</h5>

            <h5 style="font-style: normal;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">Although, the terms “design flaw”, “code smell” and “disharmony” have been used to define potential design problems, this work adopts the term code smell, or simply smell, to refer to such problems. The works discussing design problems are based on common (and expected) principles such as inheritance, information hiding or polymorphism (Meyer 1988). The authors consider that problems in design occur when these principles are broken. Then, they propose different strategies for code smell detection, which is fundamental as it affects common activities of software development, such as diagnostics in code inspection or refactoring and maintenance decisions.</h5>>

            <h5 style="font-style: normal;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">In practice, all code smell detection strategies are human-based. For example, Fowler (1999) does not provide objective criteria to identify code smells. He says that one needs to develop its own sense of observation about attributes that could characterize pieces of code as a smell. One has, for example, to develop its own sense of how many lines of code define a long method. Lanza and Marinescu (2005) used an objective definition for code smell detection based on metrics and thresholds. However, metrics and thresholds are domain dependent, again introducing subjectivity in the code smell detection process. Rapu et al. (2004) reinforced this observation declaring that metrics thresholds are mainly chosen based on the experience of the analysts. One may then speculate that code smell detection is a subjective task by nature, as its adoption is dependent on human evaluation.</h5>>

            <h5 style="font-style: normal;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">In this paper, we focus on the investigation of five factors and how they impact the human perception on detecting god class. The factors are design comprehension tool support, developer experience, developer knowledge, developer training, and software size. Here, we highlight two of our findings. First, we find out that all factors, except design comprehension tool support, affects the human perception of god classes. This supports support our hypothesis that code smell detection is more related to human traits than to an overall understanding of the code design. The idea behind this hypothesis is that, considering the smell detection activity, subjectivity should be more relevant than the understanding of the code design. Second, a training based on examples and group discussion might to mitigate divergences on human perception of god classes and, possibly, of other code smells. From this finding, we conjecture that there is no “silver bullet” in terms of heuristics for smells detection, once benefits adopting the concept are context-dependent.</h5>>

            <h4 style="font-style: normal;font-family: sans-serif;font-size: 25px; text-align: center;">The area still needs more investigation and discussion on what we call the code smell conceptualization problem, to ensure similar criteria and thresholds on human-based code smell detection.</h4>>
